- Alonzo Church: <http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Church.html>

Princeton in the 1930's was an exciting place for logic. There was Church together with his students Rosser and Kleene. There was John von Neumann. Alan Turing, who had been thinking about the notion of effective calculability, came as a visiting graduate student in 1936 and stayed to complete his Ph.D. under Church. And Kurt GÃ¶del visited the Institute for Advanced Study in 1933 and 1935, before moving there permanently.
